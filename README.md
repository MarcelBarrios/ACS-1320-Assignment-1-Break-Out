Breakout Game (OOP Refactor)
📌 What is your project?

This project is a 2D Breakout game built using pure JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It follows the tutorial from MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Create_the_Canvas_and_draw_on_it) but refactors the original code into a more structured OOP approach.

🎯 Why I Made It

This game was developed as part of a class assignment to practice JavaScript, object-oriented programming (OOP), and modular code structure. The original tutorial used a procedural approach, so I refactored the code into separate classes to improve maintainability and scalability.
